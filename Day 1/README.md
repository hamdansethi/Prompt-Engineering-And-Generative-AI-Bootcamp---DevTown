# 📘 Day 1 - Generative AI Bootcamp Notes

Hi there! 👋  
This is a personal summary of what I learned during **Day 1** of the Data Science, Generative AI, and Prompt Engineering Bootcamp I attended. The session was super informative and beginner-friendly — perfect for someone like me diving into the world of AI! 💻🧠

---

## 🧭 Session Overview

- The bootcamp kicked off with a warm welcome and quick audio checks.
- Our instructor introduced the goals of this program:  
  - Learn **Generative AI**,  
  - Understand **Prompt Engineering**,  
  - Use tools like **Langchain** and **Hugging Face**.
- No prior experience was required, which was a big relief!

## 🔍 What I Learned Today

### 🧠 What is Generative AI?
- Generative AI = a type of deep learning that creates new content (text, images, etc.).
- It works by learning from huge datasets and generating results based on patterns.
- We explored how it fits under:
  - AI → ML → Deep Learning → Generative AI
- We also looked at popular **LLMs** like:
  - **GPT**, **Claude**, **Gemini**

---

### 🤖 Chatbot Demo
- Our instructor showed us a live chatbot that could generate jokes based on a topic.
- For example, the bot cracked a joke about **smartphones**.
- It was a simple, fun way to see generative AI in action.

### 🛠 Python Setup & Virtual Environment
We learned how to set up our system for Python development:
1. **Installing Python 3.11**
2. Adding Python to the system **PATH**
3. Creating a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
4. Activating it:
   - Windows:
     ```bash
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Mac/Linux:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

---

### 🔗 Langchain Intro & Setup
- Langchain is an amazing open-source tool to build AI apps with LLMs.
- We created an account and generated an **API key**.
- Stored it safely in a `.env` file:
  ```
  LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_key_here
  ```

---

### 📦 Project Dependencies
We created a `requirements.txt` file and added:
```
langchain
python-dotenv
```
Then installed everything using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 💬 My Key Takeaways
- Creating virtual environments is super important to keep projects clean.
- Generative AI is not just hype — it's practical and fun.
- Tools like Langchain make it easier to build on top of models like GPT.
- Looking forward to building real chatbots in the upcoming sessions!
